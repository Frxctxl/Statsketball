# Statsketball

## Description
This web application allows the user to select any NBA player (active or inactive) and display their basic attributes such as jersey Number, college attended, draft year, draft pick, height and weight in a simple, easy to use interface. In addition, a widget of the current NBA season standings is displayed.
 
## Technologies Used

This website utilized the 3 major front end languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A Bulma framework was implemented for most of the styling on the website as well as the JQUERY library for added functionality. Two APIs were used to gather the data of the player and current NBA season standings.
