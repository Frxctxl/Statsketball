## Description
This web application allows the user to select any NBA player (active or inactive) and display their basic attributes such as jersey Number, college attended, draft year, draft pick, height and weight in a simple, easy to use interface. In addition, a widget of the current NBA season standings is displayed.
 
## Technologies Used
